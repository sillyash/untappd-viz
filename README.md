# untappd-viz

A data visualisation page using public datasets and HTML/CSS/JS with D3.js.

## The dataset

The dataset was made by Gruntoff, and made available on Kaggle.
It provides data from the [Untappd App](https://untappd.com/), a beer rating app used around the world.

- [Untappd Checkins - Gruntoff](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gruntoff/untappd-checkins)

This dataset compiles all the check-ins made between 2017 and 2020 in eastern Europe,
mostly in Bielorussia and Balkans.


## The website

The website uses [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) components, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
for styling and of course [D3.js](https://d3js.org) for the graphs.

No package manager needed, no framework, it's all using CDN imports.
